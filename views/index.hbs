      Hey people!
      We are doing research related to fake news propagation during monkey pox, and hence need a bit of help in
      annotating the data for the same.
      Due credit will be given if any research publication comes out of the same.

<h3>Facts about Monkeypox</h3>

    protect monkeypox. Newer vaccines have been developed, of
    which one has been approved for the prevention of monkeypox.
  </li>

  <li>Monkeypox is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the
    Orthopoxvirus genus in the family Poxviridae.</li>

  <li>Monkeypox is usually a self-limited disease with symptoms
    lasting from 2 to 4 weeks. Severe cases can occur. Recently, the
    case fatality ratio has been around 3â€“6%.</li>

  <li>Monkeypox is transmitted to humans through close contact with
    an infected person or animal or with material contaminated with
    the virus.</li>

  <li>Monkeypox virus is transmitted from one person to another by
    close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets, and
    contaminated materials such as bedding.</li>

  <li>Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral disease that occurs primarily in
    tropical rainforest areas of central and West Africa and is
    occasionally exported to other regions.</li>

  <li>An antiviral agent developed for the treatment of smallpox has
    also been licensed for the treatment of monkeypox.</li>

  <li> The clinical presentation of monkeypox resembles that of
    smallpox, a related orthopoxvirus infection declared eradicated
    worldwide in 1980. Monkeypox is less contagious than smallpox
    and causes less severe illness.
  </li>
